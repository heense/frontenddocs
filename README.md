# Novicell Frontenddocs
Standards for developing flexible, durable, and sustainable HTML and CSS.
This is the very first step of documenting our methods and work, in regards to frontend.
We still need to describe and document:
* Our gulp setup and how to use it
* Less in depth -- variables, mixins, etc.
* Writing our javascript plugins, more specifically our js objects


## Contribution

### Issue tracker

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Novicell/frontenddocs/issues) to submit [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).

### Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `css` - Issues stemming from our compiled CSS or source Less files.
- `html` - Issues stemming from the html
- `docs` - Issues for improving or updating our documentation.
- `feature` - New features should be added as `suggestion`. When discussed and assigned to a contributor, the label should be changed from `suggestion` to `feature`, and can then begin development.
- `gulp` - Issues with our Gulp setup, which is used to concatenate and compile source files, and more.
- `help wanted` - Issues we need help from the community to resolve.
- `js` - Issues stemming from our compiled or source JavaScript files.
- `suggestion` - Suggestions for a new feature to be added, or an existing one to be extended or modified. Issues with this label should not be started.
- `wontfix` - As the title says, issues that will not be fixed.

For a complete look at our labels, see the [our labels page](https://github.com/Novicell/frontenddocs/labels).
